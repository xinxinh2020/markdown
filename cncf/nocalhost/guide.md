## Using the Code Base

This document helps you get started using the Nocalhost code base. If you follow this guide and find some problem, please take a few minutes to update this page.

### Cloning the code

Clone the main `nocalhost` repo :

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nocalhost/nocalhost.git
cd nocalhost
```

### Building the code

To build nhctl for Intel Silicon

```shell
make nhctl
```

Or build nhctl for Mac M1 Silicon

```shell
make nhctl-osx-arm64
```

### Copy binary to IDE plugin work directory

VSCode and Jetbrains plugins use `nhctl` in  `~/.nh/bin`. if you want your developing version used by plugins, you need to copy `nhctl` to that directory. Take `Mac M1` for example:

```shell
cp build/nhctl-darwin-arm64 ~/.nh/bin/nhctl
```
